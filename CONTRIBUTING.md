## Structure of this repo
This repository is meant to be structured in the following way:
`the-code-land/languagename/scriptname`
So a hello world Python script could be listed at:
`python/hello_world.python`.

If the file is using a specific framework (such as NodeJS) then use the format `the-code-land/languagename/frameworkname/scriptname`
Example: `javascript/nodejs/hello_world.python`

For frameworks, you may want to add a README.md file explaining the installation of said framework.

Name files in `snake_case`.

## Things to not do
Please don't:
- Make a tiny change and PR it.
- Add code which is not helpful.
- Add code which is not your own.

By contributing, you are licensing the code under CC0.
